# Front-end Design Chicks Challenge üê£
This project involves replicating the "Items" section of Chicks Gold as part of a front-end technical challenge. The main objective was to recreate the provided design using ReactJS and pure CSS, without the use of style frameworks, to demonstrate skills in creating attractive and functional interfaces with fundamental web technologies. The application includes the following features:

- Responsive Design: The interface fluidly adapts to different screen sizes 
(desktop, tablet, and  mobile) to ensure a consistent and accessible user experience.

- Visual Consistency in Cards: The proportions and dimensions of the cards were maintained 
across all views, achieving a consistent and orderly presentation of the elements.



## Getting Started  üöÄ

For the development of this project, a combination of tools and programming languages was utilized to ensure efficient and robust implementation. Vite served as the build tool, offering a modern and faster development environment. The project was built using React, JavaScript, and CSS. React provided a structured framework for creating the application's components, while JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality. CSS was implemented to achieve the visual styling and presentation. All of these tools and languages are widely adopted and recognized in the web development industry, ensuring compatibility and maintainability of the project in the long term.
